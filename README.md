# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Module 7 Challenge 

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis was done to:
- Determine the number of retiring employees per title, and 
- Identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
The Pewlett-Hackard Employee Database (PH-EmployeeDB) was used to create queries, tables and CSV files of the resulting information.  
### Results: 
Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
### Summary: 
Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
